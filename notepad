üñ•Ô∏è KB Article: App/Window Sharing Missing in Microsoft Teams (VDI via Thin Client or CWA for Linux)

üìå Issue

When connecting to a Virtual Desktop via Thin Client or Citrix Workspace App (CWA) for Linux, the App and Window sharing options in Microsoft Teams are missing. Only Screen sharing is available.

üéØ Affected Users
	‚Ä¢	Users accessing VDI through Thin Clients (Linux-based)
	‚Ä¢	Users using Citrix Workspace App for Linux
	‚Ä¢	Microsoft Teams running in VDI optimized mode

‚∏ª

üîç Cause

This limitation is typically due to a missing or disabled Citrix policy, specifically the Graphics > Screen Drag Policy.

Without this policy enabled, Microsoft Teams running in a Citrix-optimized VDI session cannot present App/Window sharing functionality.

‚∏ª

üß™ Workaround (Temporary)

Users can continue to share their entire screen as a temporary workaround:
	1.	Start or join a Teams meeting.
	2.	Click Share.
	3.	Select Screen (not Window or App).

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: All open apps and windows will be visible during screen sharing.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Resolution Path (Permanent Fix)

To request the required configuration change, users must send an email to the support team. IT will evaluate and apply the necessary Citrix Graphics Screen Drag Policy.
