🖥️ KB Article: App/Window Sharing Missing in Microsoft Teams (VDI via Thin Client or CWA for Linux)

📌 Issue

When connecting to a Virtual Desktop via Thin Client or Citrix Workspace App (CWA) for Linux, the App and Window sharing options in Microsoft Teams are missing. Only Screen sharing is available.

🎯 Affected Users
	•	Users accessing VDI through Thin Clients (Linux-based)
	•	Users using Citrix Workspace App for Linux
	•	Microsoft Teams running in VDI optimized mode

⸻

🔍 Cause

This limitation is typically due to a missing or disabled Citrix policy, specifically the Graphics > Screen Drag Policy.

Without this policy enabled, Microsoft Teams running in a Citrix-optimized VDI session cannot present App/Window sharing functionality.

⸻

🧪 Workaround (Temporary)

Users can continue to share their entire screen as a temporary workaround:
	1.	Start or join a Teams meeting.
	2.	Click Share.
	3.	Select Screen (not Window or App).

⚠️ Note: All open apps and windows will be visible during screen sharing.

⸻

✅ Resolution Path (Permanent Fix)

To request the required configuration change, users must send an email to the support team. IT will evaluate and apply the necessary Citrix Graphics Screen Drag Policy.

Subject: Request to Enable Graphics Screen Drag Policy for Teams App/Window Sharing

Body:
Hello,

I am unable to use App or Window sharing in Microsoft Teams while connected to VDI via Thin Client (CWA for Linux). I would like to request that the required Citrix policy be enabled to restore this functionality.

Please find my system details below:

- Full Name:
- Department:
- Thin Client Model and OS:
- Citrix Workspace App Version:
- VDI Platform (e.g., Citrix Virtual Apps & Desktops):
- Teams Version (if known):
- Screenshot of Share options (optional):

I understand this may require enabling the Citrix "Graphics > Screen Drag Policy."

Thank you,  
[Your Name]



Internal IT Notes (for Support Team)
	•	Confirm Teams is running in Citrix VDI optimized mode.
	•	Check if the “Graphics > Screen Drag Policy” is applied to the affected delivery group or user policy.
	•	Policy Path in Citrix Studio:
HDX Policy > Graphics > Screen Drag Policy → Set to Allowed
	•	A reboot or logoff may be required after applying the policy.
	•	Verify CWA for Linux is updated to a compatible version (23.08 or newer recommended).
